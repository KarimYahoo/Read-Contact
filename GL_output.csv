In that case the additional period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance.  ","  Bankruptcy  Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured's estate will not relieve us of our obligations under this Coverage Part.  Duties In The Event Of Occurrence Offense Claim Or Suit  Notice Of Occurrence Or Offense  You or any additional insured must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an ""occurrence"" or an offense which may result in a claim. To the extent possible notice should include:  How when and where the ""occurrence"" or offense took place;  The names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses; and  The nature and location of any injury or damage arising out of the ""occurrence"" or offense.

Additional Insureds Other Insurance  If we cover a claim or ""suit"" under this Coverage Part that may also be covered by other insurance available to an additional insured such additional insured must submit such claim or ""suit"" to the other insurer for defense and indemnity.

Legal Action Against Us  No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part:  To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a ""suit"" asking for damages from an insured; or  To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.  A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us the insured and the claimant or the claimant's legal representative.  Other Insurance  If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part our obligations are limited as follows:  Primary Insurance  This insurance is primary except when b. below applies. If other insurance is also primary we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in c. below.  Excess Insurance  This insurance is excess over any of the other insurance whether primary excess contingent or on any other basis:  Coverage On Other Than A Claims-Made Basis  That is effective prior to the beginning of the policy period shown in the Declarations of this insurance and applies to ""bodily injury"" or ""property damage"" on other than a claims-made basis if:  No Retroactive Date is shown in the Declarations of this insurance;  The other insurance has a policy period which continues after the Retroactive Date shown in the Declarations of this insurance;  Your Work  That is Fire Extended Coverage Builder's Risk Installation Risk or similar coverage for ""your work"";  Premises Rented To You  That is fire lightning or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner;  Tenant Liability  That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for ""property damage"" to premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner;  Aircraft Auto Or Watercraft  If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft ""autos"" or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of Section I – Coverage A – Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability;  Property Damage to Borrowed Equipment Or Use Of Elevators  If the loss arises out of ""property damage"" to borrowed equipment or the use of elevators to the extent not subject to Exclusion j. of Section I - Coverage A - Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability;  When You Are Added As An Additional Insured To Other Insurance  Any other insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations or products and completed operations for which you have been added as an additional insured by that insurance; or  When You Add Others As An Additional Insured To This Insurance  Any other insurance available to an additional insured.  However the following provisions apply to other insurance available to any person or organization who is an additional insured under this coverage part.  Primary Insurance When Required By Contract  This insurance is primary if you have agreed in a written contract written agreement or permit that this insurance be primary. If other insurance is also primary we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in c. below.  Primary And Non-Contributory To Other Insurance When Required By Contract  If you have agreed in a written contract written agreement or permit that this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional insured's own insurance this insurance is primary and we will not seek contribution from that other insurance.  Paragraphs a. and b. do not apply to other insurance to which the additional insured has been added as an additional insured.  When this insurance is excess we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the insured against any ""suit"" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that ""suit"". If no other insurer defends we will undertake to do so but we will be entitled to the insured's rights against all those other insurers.  When this insurance is excess over other insurance we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss if any that exceeds the sum of:  The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.  We will share the remaining loss if any with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.  Method Of Sharing  If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains whichever comes first.  If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares we will contribute by limits. Under this method each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.  Premium Audit  We will compute all premiums for this Coverage Part in accordance with our rules and rates.  Premium shown in this Coverage Part as advance premium is a deposit premium only. At the close of each audit period we will compute the earned premium for that period and send notice to the first Named Insured. The due date for audit and retrospective premiums is the date shown as the due date on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned premium we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.  The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computation and send us copies at such times as we may request.  Representations  When You Accept This Policy  By accepting this policy you agree:  The statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete;  Those statements are based upon representations you made to us; and  We have issued this policy in reliance upon your representations.  Unintentional Failure To Disclose Hazards  If unintentionally you should fail to disclose all hazards relating to the conduct of your business that exist at the inception date of Coverage Part we shall not deny coverage under this Coverage Part because of such failure.  Separation Of Insureds  Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured this insurance applies:  As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and  Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or ""suit"" is brought.  Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us  Transfer of Rights Of Recovery  If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment including Supplementary Payments we have made under this Coverage Part those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request the insured will bring ""suit"" or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.  Waiver Of Rights Of Recovery (Waiver Of Subrogation)  If the insured has waived any rights of recovery against any person or organization for all or part of any payment including Supplementary Payments we have made under this Coverage Part we also waive that right provided the insured waived their rights of recovery against such person or organization in a contract agreement or permit that was executed prior to the injury or damage.  When We Do Not Renew  If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations written notice of the nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date.  If notice is mailed proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice.  Your Right To Claim And Occurrence Information  We will provide the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations the following information relating to this and any preceding general liability claims-made Coverage Part we have issued to you during the previous three years:  A list or other record of each ""occurrence"" not previously reported to any other insurer of which we were notified in accordance with Paragraph 2.a. of the Section IV – Duties In The Event Of Occurrence Offense Claim Or Suit Condition. We will include the date and brief description of the ""occurrence"" if that information was in the notice we received.  A summary by policy year of payments made and amounts reserved stated separately under any applicable General Aggregate Limit and Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit.  Amounts reserved are based on our judgment. They are subject to change and should not be regarded as ultimate settlement values.  You must not disclose this information to any claimant or any claimant's representative without our consent.  If we cancel or elect not to renew this Coverage Part we will provide such information no later than 30 days before the date of policy termination. In other circumstances we will provide this information only if we receive a written request from the first Named Insured within 60 days after the end of the policy period. In this case we will provide this information within 45 days of receipt of the request.  We compile claim and ""occurrence"" information for our own business purposes and exercise reasonable care in doing so. In providing this information to the first Named Insured we make no representations or warranties to insureds insurers or others to whom this information is furnished by or on behalf of any insured. Cancellation or non-renewal will be effective even if we inadvertently provide inaccurate information.  ","  We will provide one or more Extended Reporting Periods as described below if:  This Coverage Part is canceled or not renewed; or  We renew or replace this Coverage Part with insurance that:  Has a Retroactive Date later than the date shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part; or  Does not apply to ""bodily injury"" ""property damage"" or ""personal and advertising injury"" on a claims-made basis.  Extended Reporting Periods do not extend the policy period or change the scope of coverage provided. They apply only to claims for:  ""Bodily injury"" or ""property damage"" that occurs before the end of the policy period but not before the Retroactive Date if any shown in the Declarations; or  ""Personal and advertising injury"" caused by an offense committed before the end of the policy period but not before the Retroactive Date if any shown in the Declarations.

The Basic Extended Reporting Period does not apply to claims that are covered under any subsequent insurance you purchase or that would be covered but for exhaustion of the amount of insurance applicable to such claims.  The Basic Extended Reporting Period does not reinstate or increase the Limits of Insurance.  A Supplemental Extended Reporting Period of unlimited duration is available but only by an endorsement and for an extra charge. This supplemental period starts when the Basic Extended Reporting Period set forth in Paragraph 3. above ends.  You must give us a written request for the endorsement within 60 days after the end of the policy period. The Supplemental Extended Reporting Period will not go into effect unless you pay the additional premium promptly when due.  We will determine the additional premium in accordance with our rules and rates. In doing so we may take into account the following:  The exposures insured;  Previous types and amounts of insurance;  Limits of Insurance available under this Coverage Part for future payment of damages; and  Other related factors.  The additional premium will not exceed 200% of the annual premium for this Coverage Part.  This endorsement shall set forth the terms not inconsistent with this Section applicable to the Supplemental Extended Reporting Period including a provision to the effect that the insurance afforded for claims first received during such period is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available under policies in force after the Supplemental Extended Reporting Period starts.  If the Supplemental Extended Reporting Period is in effect we will provide the supplemental aggregate limits of insurance described below but only for claims first received and recorded during the Supplemental Extended Reporting Period.  The supplemental aggregate limits of insurance will be equal to the dollar amount shown in the Declarations in effect at the end of the policy period for such of the following limits of insurance for which a dollar amount has been entered:  General Aggregate Limit Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit  Paragraphs 2. and 3. of Section III – Limits Of Insurance will be amended accordingly.
